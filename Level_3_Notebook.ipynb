The notebooks follow a multi-level data product structure, where each level represents a different stage of data processing and analysis.\n\n## Specific Introduction to Level 3\nLevel 3 focuses on advanced analysis and transformation of the data collected and processed in the previous levels. This includes applying statistical models, machine learning algorithms, predictive analytics, and other complex data processing techniques. The goal is to derive insights, patterns, and actionable intelligence from the data.\n\nSince we are working with simulated data, this notebook will outline the structure and pseudocode for the intended analysis, providing a blueprint for future implementation when real data is available.",
